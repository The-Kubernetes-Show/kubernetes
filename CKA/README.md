A set of exercises to help you prepare for the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/)

This course outline is structured to align with the [CKA Curriculum v1.33](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_v1.33.pdf), following the recommended topic weights and a logical learning progression from foundational to advanced concepts.

---
#### Prerequisite: a list of topics already covered "before" aligning to latest CKA Curriculum
> ###### These topics are "still relevent and an excellent place to start". These topics give you deep insights into the concepts of K8S which comes handy to pass the CKA exam.
